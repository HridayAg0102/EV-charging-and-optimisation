# EV-charging-and-optimisation
## Minor Project 2022 (Electrical vehicle charging and load optimisation)

**[Research paper for data and reference](./kakran2018.pdf)**

This project focuses majorly on optimizing the load of a household. We have considered 21 appliances, and their preferred time of usage by the family owning them.

You can get a hint of the algorithm by the provided video.
Same project is implemented in the hardware format as well, and the code and image of the simulation is provided in the [`Hardware`](./Hardware/) folder.
